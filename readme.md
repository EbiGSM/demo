# Vanilo Demo Application

This is a minimalistic Laravel 5.5 application that demonstrates how to build a simple storefront
using the Vanilo framework. It also contains Vanilo's admin panel.

This application uses the default frontend style that comes with Laravel out of the box. This way I
believe it's easy to keep focus on how to use Vanilo's shop features.

For more information refer to the [Vanilo Documentation](https://vanilo.io/docs/).
